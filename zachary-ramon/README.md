# Project Name

**Author**: Zachary Schumpert and Ramon Mendoza
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a general blog consisting of meat, cat and baseball related information.  A user can come to this webpage for info on all three topics!

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
They would need to create an image folder to hold the pretty kitty/meat/baseball images.  They need to download all the appropriate fonts and icons. Include links to their twitter, github, about and home pages.  Use CSS to display list items and hide them at certain viewport widths.  Also running a live-server helps.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
There are multiple CSS style files linked to the DOM and each CSS file is organized based on SMACSS. A github url is linked to the DOM as well. Next, a nav contains a list of four ul li's.  Within the section are articles and relevant information for the user to read. Viewport width changes what is displayed on the screen, dependant on the user's viewport. There is a menu using :hover to display or hide additional links the user can access.
